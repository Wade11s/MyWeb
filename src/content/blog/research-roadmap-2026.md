This year we are focusing on three lines of work.

## Reliable Decision Metrics
How do we measure model quality when decision costs are asymmetric and dynamic?

## Fast Adaptation Under Shift
Can we adapt medium-size models with strict calibration guarantees and low compute budgets?

## Human-AI Collaboration Protocols
What interface and confidence signals help experts override models effectively?

The lab goal is to produce methods that can ship, not just benchmark well.
