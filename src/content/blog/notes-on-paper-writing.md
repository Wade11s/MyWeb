Clear papers are easier to review, easier to cite, and easier to build on.

My writing process starts from figures, not text. If a contribution cannot be represented by one compact figure and one explicit claim, the narrative is usually under-specified.

## Drafting Sequence
1. Figure-first outline
2. Method section with operational detail
3. Results with one-sentence claims per table
4. Related work that explains positioning, not just citations

## Common Failure Pattern
Many drafts mix limitation statements into conclusions too late. Add a dedicated limitations subsection early; it increases reviewer trust and sharpens scope.

The best revision strategy is structural: rewrite section objectives before rewriting sentences.
